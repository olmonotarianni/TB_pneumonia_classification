# TB_pneumonia_classification
We show the potential for DL/CNN models for classification of tuberculosis (TB) from chest radiography images. We align with WHO's promotion of improving the accessibility, together with the quality, of diagnostic services. By using models built from scratch and XAI techniques, we try to understand how the model arrived at a particular diagnosis.
